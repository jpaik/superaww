Creating a Reddit API-based website that shows pictures of cute animals.  

## Todo List
Get gif links working instead of bruting them to jpg  
Add a check for removed sources or deleted photos  
Display a navbar with info and functions  
Make the images click and draggable?(Maybe not needed)  
Get a domain name and proper hosting?  
~~Get the web application running~~  
~~Add checks for non directly linked images~~  
~~Add padding to panel and fix alignment of masonry~~  
~~Create more functions to make it run smoother~~  
~~Popup zoom in picture when clicked~~  
~~Design the front end for the application~~
